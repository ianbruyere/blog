## Day 8
Stomping the final UI thing didn't take too long.  
I used `pdb`, Pythons debugging module, for the first time;
which was exciting! Typically I spray `print`s all over the place  
and figure out the issue. However I felt I needed the stack for figuring  
out the event loop. It's quite cool, and a lot different then the IDE  
debugging I'm used to, but still simple and informative.
Onto the network!
