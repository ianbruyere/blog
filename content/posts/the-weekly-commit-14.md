I don’t have anything I’m making any huge waves on. I’ve got some things brewing in the back of my mind in terms of fun projectsm but no action.  
Rather I’ve been thinking over how much of programming - and life in general - is mainly talking. My new(ish) job has tons of meetings, more than my previous experience. And at first, it was galling: I was constantly thinking “When are these meetings going to end so I can do the real work”. And some of them **were** unnecessary, poorly scheduled, and of little merit.  
But now that I’ve been there for a little bit, things have smoothed out and while I still don’t __enjoy__ them, I see there merit. Honestly, some of the stuff we’ve been working on for the past couple of sprints I wish we had had more meetings. The end result is that I have less work, less pressure, more help, and it’s part of working on a team and getting things done.  
Lesson Learned.
