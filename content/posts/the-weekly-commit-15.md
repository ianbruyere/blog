So...*again* I had to troubleshoot this Hugo site. For some reason all my local changes got overwritten.
And my backup situation was less than ideal. Managed to preserve all my posts and their timestamps, but as the result of 5 hours
of work. Not fun. But done and if this happens in the future should be able to reinstate much easier.  
Keeping the flame of the weekly commit alive.
### The Doing
Starting to learn some Linux Admin Stuff.  
Also had another post planned for this week that was originally going to in this weekly commit but I actually might make an offical post outside of this theme of "Weekly Commits" *GASP*.
### The Learning
Has ground to a halt. But mainly because I've been changing my setup. Should resume soon.
Still doing the exercises for proving multiplication since I dumped about a week into potentially figuring out how to install vanilla Android on a tablet only to find out it's impossible for this model.
### The Futue
Getting back on track with my small committments in time.
