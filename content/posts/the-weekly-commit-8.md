Python is becoming easier. Building quick and dirty tools to accomplish busy work are at my fingertips instead of buried in documentation. Now coding is even __more__ fun because I can play around on my own. Bash scripting is getting there too; some syntax throws me(brackets for conditionals…really!?) but I’m getting there. The feedback of finishing these small tasks keeps that addictive question “What else can I do?” on loop.  
Mixing it up has always been a net positive for me in the long run; it just takes exploring to apply it to different activties. I think I’ve figured it out for coding.  
It’s three sizes, not two: 
* small projects(done in minutes to a couple hours) 
* medium(done in a day or over the course of a week)
* large(weeks to months to years). 
Hopefully with all the variation, it’ll keep me fresh, and more importantly, excited.
### The Doing
* Wrote more python scripts
* Tried to write a webscraper, but the data I want was inside of an iframe, and hard to get to, hopefully I can finish that up.
### The Future
* Actually start the Wes Bos stuff
* Write a test
