## Day 7
**Commit Hash**: a1f55212d407076b77610eec374f20b8f86b89ca   
Completed all the UI features. One can split the army, 
muster new units, and resolve battles. Points will be granted  
to the victor, and the UI updates accordingly. One final visual  
glitch is present, and once I finally chase that down, it's on to  
transmitting data around.  
  
I both think this will be simple and hard. There's definitely some  
thinking I'll have to throw into it. I think my server will have to   
have lobby-like functionality. Something to worry about when I've stamped
out the UI problem; who knows, it  may not be trivial, but hopefully not. 
I'm ready for new problems.
