Wow. Instruction is hard. Mad respect to anyone who can teach anything and even one person get's one they are saying.
I __attempted__ to teach a friend the basics of coding. A surprising nodule of difficuly was making sure I'd covered all the bases
of assignment. After consulting the general lesson layout of other beginner tutorials assignment seemed as good a starting place as any.
However as I wrote later sections I returned to that lesson time and time again to ensure that proper foundations and understanding was there for
later concepts. I still feel I did not do a good job.  
It's a work-in-progress; I didn't even complete the version I thought would be good enough for a 2-3hour bootcamp. The goal is that by the end it's comprehensive enough 
that you'll be able to solve easy tasks with coding. __Thinking__ about such problems is not in the framework...yet. I did include a high-level design document for a program
I thought would be a good tool for my friends and I. It's been on the backburner for me for a minute and I thought it would be more valuable as a training tool instead of me banging it out 
in an afternoon by myself.  
This is all the public repo [stunning-umbrella|https://github.com/ianbruyere/stunning-umbrella]. Clone away. I'll take critique in the github comments.
