Again not too much going on. Just plugging away.
### The Doing
Continuing to at code on my own once a week. This week I stubbed out some data processing on a weightlifting spreadsheet I’ve been updating for some years now. Eventually it will be full-flegded with graphing and filters and packaged in it’s own Jupyter notebook but for now: cleaning and enforcing data-entry.
### Learning
Still committing to the 20 minutes of learning. Currently in the midst of proving multiplication. This has to be like the third time I’ve learned induction, but I feel I’m __learning__ it this time since I’m taking the time to question it. Some of the underpinnings of __why__ induction works escaped me; due to this well-written [Stack Exchange|https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/106404/mathematical-induction-question-why-can-we-assume-pk-holds] post I can calm the turbulence in my mind that hates not understanding. This intentionally slower paced, low-committment method is going to get me where I’m going and allow me to explore all the sidepaths I want.
