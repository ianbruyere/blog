**The Weekly Commit** is a bit of a misnomer right now since I’m not committed to anything. A bit all over the place this week, from trying out the Android ecosystem to Bluetooth.  
I chart my path by not having one.
### The Doing
* attempted to find the local database on a phone that contained training data I wanted
	* I wasn’t succesful, and most resources I googled assumed the app was my own proect. I’ll look into rooting, which may destroy the data I’m after. While it’d be nice if the app had a export to csv feature, the incentive to learn about the world in my pocket is nice to have.
* Gave another friend a mini-project to help them learn to code. It’s actually a project worth doing, not a toy, though it’s not “easy” in the sense that by the end they’ll know a lot. Most importantly they’ll have something they actually want. Lookng forwarding to seeing if this helps them at all.
### The Learning
* I signed up for a 7 part bluetooth email course via [novelbits.io|https://www.novelbits.io/]. I like the __idea__ of newsletter courses because they box you off from overreaching in a time management sense.
### The Future
* Finish this BT course, see where it takes me.
* Take the Wes Bos course
* Root my phone(if it’s the only way)
* Write a test.
