### The Doing
Made a CLI in python to process some Personal Training Data. It's standard as dataprocessing goes: input
a csv, clean it, outputs interesting information in csv. Other than being practically useful for myself, it allowed me to scrape the rust off my Python. The Python Standard Library is vast, and my goal of having it close at hand is only possible through constant practice. Suddenly having full-time work day disrupted my rhythm; doing some personal coding is a sign I haven't lost the beat.
### Learning
Focusing on practical learnings that orbits around a personal project that I'm eager to bring out of hiatus. Learning more about Pytest and Kubernetes since I plan on deploying this project to a live environment. With testing I'm prone to analysis paralysis so slapping something together sooner rather than later to fend that off. Kubernetes seems cool; each part of your site running in it's own pod.
### Near Future Goals
Lay down some testing for my project; than start rocking out the frontend(React). There are a couple of mini-projects bouncing around too: a sentence breather and a Netflix data cruncher.
