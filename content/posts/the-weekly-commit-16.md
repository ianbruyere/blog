I get my stuff done, test it but boneheaded mistakes have a way of creeping in.  
I _could_ try and justify it: a new process, not entirely sure of the common checks you learn when something becomes routine; but the reality is my behavior towards development needs changing.
 Mistakes are costly from a time perspective, especially when priorties have shifted away from development and towards validation and release.  
I'm learning to be a little slower with my development; it'll save me time and hassle in the long run.
### The Doing
* Going through some Linux System Admin stuff.
### The Future
Is in flux, going to discontinue this section, since it has _no_ bearing on anything I do week to week.
