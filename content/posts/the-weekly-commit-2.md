### The Doing 
Not too much doing. The crush of Christmas and New Years being what it is. Mainly finding the threads of _where_ I left off in my own code. Mainly in the testing section, simply need to remember where I was questing.
### Learning
Did some brief overview of security stuff. Mainly laying down some lead lines for future(far off) endeavors. Nothing much.
### Near-Future Goals
About the same. Start on my project in earnest as time and sanity allows, also keep up with my own small projects as buffers against code-block and staleness.
