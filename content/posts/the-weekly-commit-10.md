Nothing too much in the meta today.

### The Doing
* Used RegEx casually. An exoctic feeling since I used to actively **avoid** RegEx; I still need StackOverflow - and a testbed - it’s __still__ RegEx after all but I understand the methodoloy and can write basic blocks without reference.
### The Learning
I’ve decicded to reboot my Theoretical learning starting with mathematics. My goal is low-level commitment, emphasis on **commit**: 20 minutes a day is all I’m going for. Overzealous commits are a scourge: it’s exciting to think “If I give 2 hours a day, make this much progress per week, and wowsers in 2 months I’ll be a PRO”… day 3 comes and that enthusiasm is in the dumpster and it’s back to Netflix. This way I can be somewhere in 1 year __and__ watch Netflix.  
Much better.

* Went through the email course for Bluetooth. Not too much in the practical sense; an overview of the different abstractions like Controller, Advertiser, GAP, etc.
	* I did download a tool but had little sense in how to use it. Will need more hands on time, so ican extract the protocol so I can actually interact with the BT device I’m interested in.
### The Future
* Hopefully I can manage my new committment schedule.
* Wes Bos here I come.
* Not even going to say Test Cases…for now.
