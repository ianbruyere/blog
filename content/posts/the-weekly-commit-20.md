Sadly a dud week in the productivity department; I feel about due to churning again though.
But in some ways this give's me an opportunity to speak about commitment.  
It'd be nice if every single post was overflowing with the bounty of my endeavors, but I simply don't see 
that happening. I have a job, people I care about, other hobbies, and strong desires at times to simply sit back and let the world spin.
I won't adorn some apologetic nature for that; a previous me would've sat despondant amidst the remants of overly-ambitious plans.
That fifteen minutes a day was better than none, so is 5, and even when zero is doen that making sure 5 days out of 7 doesn't spiral into losing my grip on trying at all.
It's about seeing the project as a whole; this blog isn't simply one post, it's **ALL** of them, even if some are lackluster comapred to others.
