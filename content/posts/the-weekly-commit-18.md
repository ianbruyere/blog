Life busy this week. I **am** preparing an informal bootcamp on coding for some of my friends this weekend.
I've been experimenting with teaching coding. I'm not good at it but through my own constant learning(and discovering of pitfalls)
I try and pass it on to other people I know.
Teaching is for everyone; people might say you have to have a knack for it, and I don't discount that being naturally disposed towards certain personality traits are a plus - patience, understanding, empathy come to mind - but
teaching is simply good communication. And the sum total of all human endeavor is communication; 
words, music, painting, and anything that is a product of those(literally everything) is a form of communication.  
There's a reason *EVERY* employer states that they want employees who are **good** at communicating.
And of all the bull I've read on job postings, that is the only one I fully believe they care about as much as they say and if they don't they should.
Doing something, thinking about it, recieving feedback, is how you get good at *everything*.
Working at teaching is working on communicating, and communication is everything.
