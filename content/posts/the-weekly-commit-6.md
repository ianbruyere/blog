As a continuation of last week: deleting the old gcc files had no detrimental effect on my computer. However, hugo this time(since now I don't trust brew) was a bit of pain. Now I think it's all sorted and honestly, learned even more about the Linux shell environment. I'm a young whippersnapper when it comes to Linux and in a lot of ways computers in general, so I'm not tearing through the shell ripping apart build processes or anything like that...yet; Linux can be as wild as you want but I'm glad I can take it at my own pace.

### The Doing
* Wrote a Python script to convert json objects to user-specified-character delimited things. Needed it so I could grab fieldnames out of metadata
* More familiar with bash, scripting, Linux environment
* Did some things with git beyond yeh nasic boy commands - push, pull, add, commit - and succesfully messed around with rebase, ammend, and hooks.

### The Learning
* Will get rid of this section unless I'm doing theoretical learnings, right now learning is doing so this is redundant
* Theoretical things for the future:
	* Compiler(build one)
	* Database Systems
	* Algorithms(this is sadly STILL not in my wheelhouse, hopefully in a few months once the new job has become old hat)
	* Type Theory
	* Complexity Theory

After seeing the above people be wondering what I DO know.

### The Future
Testing.
